Think about that - only 2 out of 10 professional developers actually enjoy what they&amp;rsquo;re doing.
This feels really wrong. When you look at the factors that contribute to happiness and unhappiness at work, about 50% relates to things like improving code quality, learning new technologies, building environments, or working on architecture.</description></item></channel></rss>
