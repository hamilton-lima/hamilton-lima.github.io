AI would do everything for us, right? Maybe that would be a future concern, something for generations down the road—it&amp;rsquo;s hard to predict what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen.

Jenkins was created to automate builds and any sort of workflows after developers send their code to the server, so it&amp;rsquo;s able to automate virtually anything, and that what I did used it on my own machine to automate some tasks:</description></item><item><title>Closing github issues on commit</title><link>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/closing-github-issues-on-commit/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Oct 2016 19:13:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/closing-github-issues-on-commit/</guid><description>There is no better place to keep track of opensource projects issues, than the issues page at github :) like this one: https://github.com/hamilton-lima/vanhackaton-video-editor/issues And as expected there is an automated way to close the issues with comments from your commit messages.
