I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on this project for some years and last year decided to rewrite everything, mainly for the sake of technical exploration and this post share challenges using Redis Publish and subscribe.
Proving the concept Before I start to hit the keyboard to refactor MatchStatePublisher to send match states to Redis, I had some homework to do.</description></item><item><title>From counters to promises a javascript journey</title><link>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/from-counters-to-promises-a-javascript-journey/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2017 13:21:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/from-counters-to-promises-a-javascript-journey/</guid><description>Beauty always promises, but never gives anything. Simone Weil
Unlike beauty, javascript promises are faithful, and will be fulfilled&amp;hellip; unless someone rejects it :) If you ever need to load images using javascript or did anything that needs to wait until something is done, you probably used a promise, maybe even without noticing. I see Promises as a nice way to simplify the callback hell, but don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled, the callbacks are still there, they are only organized in a more simpler way.</description></item><item><title>Increase Ant Hibernate Junit tests Performance by 80%</title><link>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/increase-ant-hibernate-junit-tests-performance-by-80/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2016 20:52:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/increase-ant-hibernate-junit-tests-performance-by-80/</guid><description>If don´t want to read everything, just set forkingmode=&amp;quot;once&amp;rdquo; to have huge improvement in your tests processing time. :)
Now the details&amp;hellip; I have several, around 100 junit tests in Robolucha project, most of then use Hibernate and are run by an ant script. When you start Java Virtual machine Hibernate prepares itself to connect to the database by checking the necessary tables and preparing all the internals needed to work, but this process takes some time, some seconds to say the true.</description></item><item><title>Holidays selfhackaton - the start</title><link>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/holidays-selfhackaton-the-start/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2016 15:46:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/holidays-selfhackaton-the-start/</guid><description>The selfhackaton plan!
During this holidays celebration week, I will join myself in a hackaton! Me myself and I will code several new features to Robolucha.
The image above shows the sprint meeting board, when my stakeholder, a.k.a. wife forced me to define priorities and a clear order of what to deliver during this week :) Translating the characters above for something more understandable, here is the list:
post about the selfhackaton itself describing the goals (done) merge move() and turn() methods in only one command queue so the commands are not executed in parallel rename start/repeat methods to setup/loop adopting &amp;ldquo;arduino-like&amp;rdquo; names post about the ant &amp;amp; hibernate unit tests optimization convert robolucha game presentation layer, the arena itself, to an angular component create the first version of the map editor using the new presentation layer add obstacles to the map editor create the server API to use in map editor elements create new games using the new map editor definitions Let´s code!</description></item><item><title>Robolucha mask editor</title><link>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/robolucha-mask-editor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2016 22:35:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/robolucha-mask-editor/</guid><description>Today Robolucha was updated including the mask editor, where you can customize your luchador mask, and see it in the arena! You can change colors and forms for several different layers, give a try and show your creativity with new cool masks for your luchador. Try the new mask editor here: http://ring.robolucha.com If you don´t know robolucha, it is a fantastic game I created where you can code your &amp;ldquo;luchadores&amp;rdquo; using javascript and battle in an arena with your friends.</description></item><item><title>The birth of robolucha</title><link>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/the-birth-of-robolucha/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2016 00:28:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/the-birth-of-robolucha/</guid><description>Several years ago, on 2004, when I was a teacher the Unicarioca University, I used robocode to make the Java learning more interesting. That was fantastic, the students were able to move their objectives from the code to build a robot that could perform better than others.

After everybody finished their coding, all robots packed as jar files were sent to the teacher, a.</description></item></channel></rss>
