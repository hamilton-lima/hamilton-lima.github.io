So many options There are some posssibilities
Pay some email API services, oh GMAIL why you don&amp;rsquo;t have it?</description></item><item><title>Avoid insanity when handling errors with Chai</title><link>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/avoid-insanity-when-handling-errors-with-chai/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jul 2021 10:34:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/avoid-insanity-when-handling-errors-with-chai/</guid><description>If you ever played Farcry3 for sure you will remember the guy in the picture, if you never hear about him, Take a look on this video, The definition of insanity - Far Cry 3.
