One very experienced guy on SAP technologies said:
I never saw Price as an entity, allways saw as attribute, why you made Price an Entity?
And support his question he also send some example structure. My first was, I had no idea why the model has price as entity :) but after some thinking, I just realized that I model in the way I tought about the business.</description></item></channel></rss>
