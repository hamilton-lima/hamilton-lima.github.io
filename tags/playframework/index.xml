Enable Cross Origin Resource Sharing!
Those beatiful words means: We sould tell the server to allow other servers to call our services :) As we are not doing any kind of authentication we should let any server make the calls. So we just went to http://enable-cors.</description></item><item><title>publish playframework to production</title><link>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/publish-playframework-to-production/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2016 23:06:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/publish-playframework-to-production/</guid><description>Running an playframework application locally is very easy, you just go to the folder, and run
activator run But how to put all of the necessary files at a server? end of the day we are talking about lots of files and dependencies. Luckly, playframework has a command and instructions for that, its called
dist That creates an zip file with all the necessary libraries and config files in order to run the application at the server.</description></item><item><title>beepify.io, server side release 1 - part 2</title><link>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/beepify-io-server-side-release-1-part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2016 19:58:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/beepify-io-server-side-release-1-part-2/</guid><description>The second part of the server side release 1 will describe some details about the implementation it self. please see the first part for configuration details.
Quick tips to a playframework application Of course there are tons of nice features that can be used, but for the sake of simplicity here are the concepts that I consider the most important ones for this implementation: Edit the file conf/routes to match the services urls and the implementation of it, as simple as: GET /mock controllers.</description></item><item><title>beepify.io, server side release 1 - part 1</title><link>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/beepify-io-server-side-release-1-part1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2016 19:10:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hamiltonlima.com/posts/beepify-io-server-side-release-1-part1/</guid><description>These are the server side release 1 original plan, that is complete with some minor changes highlighted on each line
Install playframework environment - not in the original plan Create the models Read current location latitude, longitude Add sample data to the database - changed to use a service to create data instead of SQL to add data Create services Get data receive product code, latitude and longitude Return all prices It´s impressive how environment setup takes time, usually we forget to include this step when planning projects, but believe me this takes of time in a project, let´s go over each step I did on this implementation.</description></item></channel></rss>
