Simone Weil
Unlike beauty, javascript promises are faithful, and will be fulfilled&amp;hellip; unless someone rejects it :) If you ever need to load images using javascript or did anything that needs to wait until something is done, you probably used a promise, maybe even without noticing. I see Promises as a nice way to simplify the callback hell, but don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled, the callbacks are still there, they are only organized in a more simpler way.</description></item><item><title>Robolucha mask editor</title><link>https://hamilton-lima.github.io/posts/robolucha-mask-editor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2016 22:35:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hamilton-lima.github.io/posts/robolucha-mask-editor/</guid><description>Today Robolucha was updated including the mask editor, where you can customize your luchador mask, and see it in the arena!
