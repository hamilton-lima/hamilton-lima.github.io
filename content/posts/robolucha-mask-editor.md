![robolucha mask editor](/images/2016/11/2016-11-21_2014.png) Today [Robolucha](http://www.robolucha.com) was updated including the mask editor, where you can customize your luchador mask, and see it in the arena! You can change colors and forms for several different layers, give a try and show your creativity with new cool masks for your luchador. Try the new mask editor here: [http://ring.robolucha.com](http://ring.robolucha.com) If you don´t know robolucha, it is a fantastic game I created where you can code your "luchadores" using javascript and battle in an arena with your friends.
