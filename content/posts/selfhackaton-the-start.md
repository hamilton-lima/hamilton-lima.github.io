When I first heard about the [Vanhackton](https://www.vanhack.com/hackathon/), all I could remember was the nice experiences with the [LudumDare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/) hackatons. With the good memories also came the lessons learned from the journey of creating something from Friday night until Sunday night, here are some lessons that I can remember:

*   Warmup with the technologies you are planning to use
*   Download and Install all the tools you will need
*   Make sure you can save files in the repository you are planning to use during the hackton
*   Make arrangements with your family, make sure they understand that you will be offline from family duties during that weekend :)
*   Sleep, seriously plan your sleep time during the weekend
*   Eat, again seriously plan to eat good food during the weekend that makes a lot of difference
*   Have fun, remember [YOLO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YOLO_(motto))

To warmup with the technologies a good option is to have a small project to create, that gives you a target and organize your mindset to build something. I will keep track of my warming up experiences, so I can remember in the future the good and the not so good decisions I made, and hopefully learn from the comments and feedbacks, letÂ´s code! ![i-just-felt-like-coding](/images/2016/10/i-just-felt-like-coding.png)
