During the craziness of COVID, many people started visiting places in their minds where, as a Theologist, I already enjoy frequent flyer status. These are not all dark places; there are certainly gray ones, and a few dark places as well. Mostly, they are places inside your head with dust and very low circulation. I am talking about questions on life and death, the meaning of our existence, and similar questions that are not usually part of lunch talk.

All these new questions coming to the surface, combined with the time given back from the commute, made these topics more and more mainstream. In July of 2022, an interesting coincidence happened. All of us on the team were wearing blue t-shirts. We did not agree or arrange that; maybe the universe did, or maybe we just felt like wearing blue for some reason. I decided to remember that day and to remember that life is full of little incredible moments, full of unique days and experiences. We just need to look closer.

To remember that day, I started to celebrate the 20th of each month as "Blue T-shirt Day," a moment to stop and appreciate life, celebrate the day, and remember to make every day countâ€”at work and in life. We should make sure not to take the months or the days for granted.

I invite you to celebrate this day as well, to remember that our time is short, and that it is best used with kindness, intentional acts, and a focus on each day. Work hard, but kindly. Build, plan, act, and collaborate, but kindly. Happy Blue T-shirt Day.
