\[caption id="attachment\_110" align="alignnone" width="800"\]![](/images/2016/12/selfhackaton-dec2016.jpg) The selfhackaton plan!\[/caption\] During this holidays celebration week, I will join myself in a hackaton! Me myself and I will code several new features to [Robolucha](http://www.robolucha.com). The image above shows the sprint meeting board, when my stakeholder, a.k.a. wife forced me to define priorities and a clear order of what to deliver during this week :) Translating the characters above for something more understandable, here is the list:

*   post about the selfhackaton itself describing the goals (done)
*   merge move() and turn() methods in only one command queue so the commands are not executed in parallel
*   rename start/repeat methods to setup/loop adopting "arduino-like" names
*   post about the ant & hibernate unit tests optimization
*   convert robolucha game presentation layer, the arena itself, to an angular component
*   create the first version of the map editor using the new presentation layer
*   add obstacles to the map editor
*   create the server API to use in map editor elements
*   create new games using the new map editor definitions

LetÂ´s code!
