![2016-10-22_0112](/images/2016/10/2016-10-22_0112.png) First proof of concept is done! I choose the challenge to build and interactive video editor that will creae layers over existing videos, nice challenge btw :) Technical details that are in this status:

*   Load video player on the fly
*   Add and remove questions layer over the video
*   Pause and Play the video
*   Forward the video x amount of seconds
*   Monitor what is the current position of the video

Now its time for next steps:

*   Add angular to the application
*   Create the UI to add the questions
*   Create a timeline interface
*   Save and load story with the questions
*   Play the story

Go go go!
