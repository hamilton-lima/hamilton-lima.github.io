In the fast-paced world we live in, stress often feels like an unwelcome companion. But what if we had a tool to navigate through it? A process can serve as just thatâ€”an anchor in the storm, a love letter from our rational self to our stressed self.

A well-defined process is like having a map. It reduces decision fatigue by laying out clear steps, helping us focus on one task at a time. This sense of accomplishment, even in small doses, can be a powerful antidote to stress. However, simplicity is key. An overly complex process can act more like poison than antidote, especially during stressful times.

A simple, adaptable checklist can be our best ally, offering guidance without rigidity. Sometimes, an item on the checklist could be to ask ourselves: Should I consider doing nothing about this? or What are we saying no to when we say yes to this option? Checklists can save us, but ultimately, it is we who save ourselves from our stressful selves. Take care of yourself and your teamâ€”and go build some checklists! ðŸ˜Š
