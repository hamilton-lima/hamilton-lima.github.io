The year is 2026, not the year of the plage, that was 2020, crazy pandemic days, now we are living at another historic moment, the year that we see artificial brains do incredible things, sure someone can say: "It's a probabilistic machine!!" That would be the same as explaining a beautiful sunset by talking about [Rayleigh scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering) and all the great eletromagnetic details. it kills the vibe, and the vibe, pun intended is way more than "vibe coding" it is an invitation to reinvent ourselves, and that can be really scary.

# 2025 was.
I like to build stuff during my vacations
- moveplayground
- permitpro
- clashofgoats
- lilarmy
lots of learning and incredible stuff at Geotab

# Everything changes
How to handle the fear of change? the shaking of the identity from builder to overseer? We should be ready for that, whoever works in technology for more than a decade already saw so many changes! Who remembers [Enterprise Service Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_service_bus), [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP), Everything Microservices, UML all over the place, and the list goes on and on, some even worked with [Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)) and [Visual basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)) on their first version. 

But no all these changes small and big feels tiny compared to what is happening now. 

# Finding joy

We are running to the scenario where we will fully overseer the build of software, we are still close to the factory, we are still in need around it, guiding details here and there, building skills and commands integrating this and that, but we know what is coming, it is a matter of time, and the challenge is how a builder learn to find joy in the overseer work. 

> Explain this

 Oh well everything changes, except war, that never changes

# Transition to smaller cycles 
welcome to my transition from hours of work building something, to observing more than one AI. The momment we take [Conductor]( https://www.conductor.build/) or [Gas Town]( https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown) approach, we face ourselves with the question: How many is too many?

# Getting angry at AI
dont do that it is silly - but dont say that: is also silly :D 
- Now I understand
- You are right

## Good practices with a different time
retrospectives one a week? no you do it many times a day with the agents and update the skills live 


# All the experts in the world
Is everybody an expert and how to build experts?

# How to build experts?


# will we have jobs?

Add the paradox as a hope! and the idea of the increased value for the 5% of the work

# danger zone

be nice to each other
